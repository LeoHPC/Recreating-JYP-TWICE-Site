### Actually, I'm trying to recreate the JYP TWICE website to improve my web developmente skills. The original website have some animations that I can't replicate in the moment, but I'm studying to work around this situation! I don't know the exact fonts used in the original version, so I looked for the most similar ones. Stay tuned for the upcoming updates!
